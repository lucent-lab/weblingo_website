# Getting Started

Welcome to WebLingo. This short guide walks through the minimal steps to go from a single-language
site to a live, localized deployment.

## Quick checklist

- Decide the target locales you want to ship first.
- Add a staging subdomain for the localized content.
- Run a small crawl to verify segmentation and translations.
- Publish when the preview looks right.

## What you will configure

1. The primary domain for your source content.
2. A CNAME target for localized traffic.
3. A translation run that produces your first deployment.

Once those are in place, WebLingo keeps translations fresh and your localized pages in sync.
