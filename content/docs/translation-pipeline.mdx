# Translation Pipeline

Every translation run follows the same deterministic flow so you can reproduce results:

## 1. Crawl

We fetch your source HTML, respect `robots.txt`, and capture snapshots for processing.

## 2. Segment + translate

HTML is segmented into stable chunks, then translated with precedence rules for overrides,
glossaries, and translation memory.

## 3. Render + publish

Translated content is applied to the original snapshot and published to the edge with localized
SEO metadata.

## 4. Monitor

When your source changes, WebLingo detects diffs and only re-translates what changed.
