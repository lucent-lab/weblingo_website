# Translation Pipeline

Every translation run follows a deterministic flow so you can reproduce results. Depending on the
request, WebLingo can crawl first or translate existing snapshots without recrawling.

## 1. Crawl (when needed)

We fetch your source HTML, respect `robots.txt`, and capture snapshots for processing.

## 2. Segment + translate

HTML is segmented into stable chunks, then translated with precedence rules for overrides,
glossaries, and translation memory.

## 3. Render + publish

Translated content is applied to the original snapshot and published to the edge with localized
SEO metadata.

## 3b. Translate without recrawl (optional)

If you already have fresh snapshots, you can trigger translation without a new crawl. This keeps
the pipeline deterministic while skipping the fetch step.

## 4. Monitor

When your source changes, WebLingo detects diffs and only re-translates what changed. Translation
runs expose status updates and can be cancelled or resumed when needed.
