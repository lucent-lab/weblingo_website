# Domain + CNAME Setup

WebLingo serves translated pages from the edge, but your source site stays exactly where it is.

## Recommended flow

1. Keep your primary domain on the existing host.
2. Add a subdomain for localized content (for example, `fr.example.com`).
3. Point the subdomain CNAME to the WebLingo target provided in the dashboard.

## Validation tips

- Verify the CNAME before launching production traffic.
- Keep an eye on SSL propagation (typically a few minutes).
- Start with a single locale before expanding to more markets.
