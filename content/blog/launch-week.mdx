# Launch Week Notes

Shipping WebLingo meant balancing speed with determinism. We focused on predictable manifests,
fast previews, and a translation loop that keeps token usage under control.

## Highlights

- Deterministic manifests make reruns trustworthy.
- CNAME-driven hosting keeps customer infra unchanged.
- A preview-first workflow catches issues early.

We will share deeper dives on the pipeline, QA, and SEO experiments soon.
