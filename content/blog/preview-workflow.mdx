# Designing the Preview Workflow

Localization teams need more than raw translations. They need confidence that output is stable
and easy to review.

## The core ideas

- Always show the exact HTML that will be shipped.
- Keep diffs small so reviewers focus on what changed.
- Separate draft and published deployments for safety.

The result is a workflow that feels predictable even when the source site moves fast.
