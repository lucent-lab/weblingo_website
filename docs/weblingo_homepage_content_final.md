## 2️⃣ Problem → Solution (Refined)

**Solution paragraph:**

> **WebLingo combines AI translation with human proofreading.**  
> You keep full control of your content through a simple dashboard — review, adjust, or lock any translation in seconds.

**CTA (inline):**

- Repeat “Free hosting · No quotas · Cancel anytime” to build trust
- Tone: friendly, reliable, slightly technical (for SMEs & agencies)
- Consistency: use “website” (singular) when referring to 1 plan, “sites” for agency plural

## Frontend Implementation Notes

- Render pricing cards below hero section (not in separate page fold).
- Add a “Compare all plan features ▾” expandable table linking to `/pricing` page.
- Keep CTAs consistent site-wide.
- Include SEO metadata: title, description, and alt tags referencing Cloudflare hosting and multilingual capabilities.
